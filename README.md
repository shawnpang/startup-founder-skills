# Startup Founder Skills for AI Agents

A collection of AI agent skills for tech startup founders. Covers the full founder stack — fundraising, sales, product, recruiting, engineering, legal, finance, and growth. Works with Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, and any agent that supports the [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io).

Built by [Shawn Pang](https://github.com/shawnpang). Inspired by [Marketing Skills](https://github.com/coreyhaines31/marketingskills) by Corey Haines.

## What are Skills?

Skills are markdown files that give AI agents specialized knowledge and workflows for specific tasks. When you add these to your project, your agent can recognize what you're working on and apply the right frameworks, templates, and best practices — so you get founder-grade output, not generic AI slop.

## How Well Does This Actually Work?

Not all founder tasks are equally automatable. We tier every skill by confidence level so you know what to trust and what to double-check.

| Tier | Meaning | What to expect |
|------|---------|----------------|
| **High** | Agent output is directly usable | Ship it after a quick skim. These are writing, research, and code tasks where AI consistently produces good results. |
| **Medium** | Good drafts, needs founder review | Saves 60-80% of the work, but you need to edit, validate, or add judgment before using. |

We intentionally excluded tasks where AI is unreliable — financial modeling, unit economics, pricing decisions, and OKR-setting. These require human judgment and verified numbers, not AI scaffolding. See [What Can and Can't Be Automated](#what-can-and-cant-be-automated) for details.

## How Skills Work Together

Every skill reads from `startup-context` first — your company's stage, product, market, team, and metrics. This shared context means skills produce output tailored to your specific startup, not generic advice.

## What Can and Can't Be Automated

### What AI agents do well

- **Writing at volume** — emails, docs, copy, posts, job descriptions, outreach sequences. This is the #1 proven use case. 82% of founders cite content generation as their top AI workflow.
- **Research and analysis** — competitor intel, market sizing, investor targeting, feedback synthesis. Cuts research time by 50-60%.
- **Code tasks** — review, CI/CD, architecture, security audits, technical SEO. The strongest overall category for coding agents.
- **Legal document drafts** — policies, terms, contracts. YC-backed startups are using AI for 8x faster contract review. Still need a lawyer for anything binding.

### What we intentionally left out

- **Financial modeling** — LLMs hallucinate historical data and can't reliably handle formula logic. An unauditable number is a useless number.
- **Unit economics / burn rate** — Same problem. Use a spreadsheet, not an AI agent.
- **Pricing decisions** — AI can research competitors' pricing, but setting your own price is a high-stakes strategic call.
- **OKR / goal-setting** — Structure is easy to template, but goals require your strategic vision. A framework without conviction is just busywork.
- **Feature prioritization** — RICE scores are only as good as the inputs. The founder who talks to customers daily will out-prioritize any scoring model.

### What requires a human, period

- **Investor meetings** — skills prep you, but you run the room
- **Hiring decisions** — skills write JDs and scorecards, but you pick the people
- **Legal sign-off** — skills draft policies and flag risks, but get a lawyer for anything binding
- **Live sales calls** — skills write your playbook, but objection handling is real-time judgment
- **Strategy** — skills give you research, but you make the bets

### The right mental model

Think of these skills as a **chief of staff that works at AI speed** — they draft, research, structure, and prepare. You review, decide, and ship. The founder who uses AI to write 10 cold emails in 5 minutes and personally reviews each one will outperform both the founder who writes 2 emails manually and the one who auto-sends 100 unreviewed AI emails.
